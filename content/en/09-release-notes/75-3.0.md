# 3.0 Release Notes (Draft)

VersionPress 3.0 is a major usability and reliability release. It is also the first release available [on GitHub](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress) as an open source project.

Released on XX April 2016. [Release blog post](TODO).


<div class="note">
  <strong>Note: this is an Early Access release</strong>
  <p>Early Access is a period during which VersionPress is reasonably stable but still young, limited in scope and an external backup is recommended at all times. [Learn more](../getting-started/about-eap).</p>

## New in 3.0

### Usability improvements

- **Searching (filtering) site's history** – [#586](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/586). You can search commits by authors, dates, commit messages, WordPress actions, etc. It's quite powerful – see the [full documentation](https://docs.versionpress.net/en/feature-focus/searching-history). 
- **Undo multiple commits at once** – [#201](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/201). Say that you trashed and then deleted a post. To fully undo these two actions, you can now select both of them using checkboxes and restore the post in one go. 
- **Environment tracking** – [#609](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/609), [#459](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/459). VersionPress now tracks where a change originated, for example, in staging, production or Bob's PC. Environment names are customizable and display a visual hint in the UI.
- **Other UI improvements**. For example, the main table now displays an avatar of users who made the changes ([#853](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/853))
- **Customizer changes produce nicer messages** – [#432](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/432). The generic *"Customized theme XYZ"* message is gone, you will now see more descriptive messages like *"Updated title ..."*, *"Updated menu ..."*, etc.
- **Service panel updates** – [#732](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/732). It now links to the System Info page and GitHub where most of the support will be happening. 


### Core versioning improvements

Most of the time in VersionPress 3.0 development was spent improving the core versioning aspects. As a result, VersionPress 3.0 supports various scenarios much better than previous releases.

- **Serialized data** are handled better – [#619](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/619), [#829](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/829). VersionPress now stores serialized data in an expanded form that is diff- and merge-friendly. It automatically improves things like IDs in widgets ([#814](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/814)) or sticky posts ([#819](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/819)).
- **Custom merge driver** was implemented to deal with some tricky scenarios:
    - **Date modified** field are now handled correctly – [#588](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/588). Before VersionPress 3.0, `post_modified` and `post_modified_gmt` fields were ignored because tracking them created a lot of merge conflicts and we thought we could compute the values from Git history anyway. However, that was not true for posts created before VersionPress was installed. VersionPress 3.0 tracks date modified's correctly.
    - **Changes on adjacent lines no longer create conflicts** – [#719](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/719). For example, if Alice updated `post_title` and Bob updated `post_content`, merging their work no longer creates a conflict.
- **Shortcodes with IDs work across environments** – [#654](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/654). Shortcodes like `[gallery ids="2,3,4"]` will now update these ID correctly across environments. New `*-shortcodes.yml` file format was developed to support this.
- **Frequent DB writes** no longer create excessive number of commits – [#512](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/512). Things like view counters, Akismet spam count etc. are now committed once in an hour (configurable in the future) or before actions like cloning and merging. This avoiding floods of not very useful commits.
- **Configurable entity ignoring** and, specifically, **better spam comment handling** – [#511](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/511). Some entities just should not be part of the repository, e.g., transient options or spam comments. Previously, some of this was hardcoded (e.g., transient options) or not handled very well at all (e.g., spam comments). VersionPress 3.0 introduces a better, extensible ignoring mechanism that will be user-configurable in the future.
- **Ignoring of specific database columns** – [#902](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/902). Similarly to ignoring entities (database rows), VersionPress can also ignore database columns. These columns are either plain ignored (for example, VersionPress doesn't care about `option_id`, only `option_name`) or ignored with a reference to a PHP function that computes the values (for example, post's `comment_count` is computed dynamically based on the actual comments).
- **Initial support for custom directory layouts** – [#565](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/565). WordPress location, `wp-content`, `plugins` or `uploads` directories can now all be customized and VersionPress will support that. The support is initial, for example, the structure needs to be defined before VersionPress is activated, more complex setups like Bedrock are not fully supported yet, etc., but it's a good first step.
- **Data updates via `query()` are now understood** – [#510](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/510). Previously, VersionPress handled data modified via `insert()`, `update()` or `delete()` methods. These are quite simple to support and WordPress core use them 99 % of the time so we started with that, but VersionPress 3.0 is much more reliable as it also supports the `query()` method and can now understand 100 % of the data updates.
- **Common (shared) config** – [#630](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/630). Most things in `wp-config.php` are environment-specific, for example, database connection, so VersionPress gitignored this file since 1.0-beta2. However, some config values should be shared, for example, custom folder constants `WP_CONTENT_DIR` or `WP_PLUGIN_DIR`. For this, VersionPress 3.0 adds a config file called `wp-config.common.php` which is committed into the repository and `require`'d from the standard `wp-config.php` file. We also ship a `wp vp config` WP-CLI command to manipulate the configuration constants.
- **General reliability improvements**. We've improved how VersionPress stores and parses the internal data formats and added some more tests to cover that.


### Other notable changes

- Better update method that keeps the same INI files and VPIDs – [#906](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/906). This allows history tracking across VersionPress releases. Note that this will only become useful *after* 3.0, for instance, for update to 4.0. Right now, we're only shipping the necessary code. There's also a convenience WP-CLI command `wp vp update` available ([PR #931](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/pull/931)).
- `vpconfig.neon` (custom configuration format) replaced by the standard `wp-config.php` constants – [#566](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/566).
- [NEON](https://ne-on.org/) file format replaced with a similar but more common YAML – [#703](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/703).
- PHP 5.6+ is now required – [#726](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/726).
- VersionPress underwent a security review and general code review by [@danielbachhuber](https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber) – thank you Daniel!
