# Contributing

If you want to make the VersionPress documentation better, there are two good ways:

 1. [Report an issue / suggest an improvement](https://github.com/versionpress/docs/issues).
 2. Fork the repo, make edits and send us a pull request. [README](./README.md) describes how the docs are authored.

Thank you!
